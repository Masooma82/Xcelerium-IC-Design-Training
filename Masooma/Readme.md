# Xcelerium Training Tasks

This document provides guidelines for compiling and evaluating lab tasks using the provided Makefile in the Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma directory.


## LAB 1
The file lab1_x.c contains source code for Lab 1 tasks. To compile and run the Lab 1 executable, execute the following command in Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma directory:

    make lab1

## Lab 2

The file lab2_x.c contains source code for first seven tasks of Lab 2. To compile and run the Lab 2 executable, execute the following command in Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma directory:

    make lab2

## Lab 3

The lab3 directory contains tasks for Lab 3. To run the first four tasks of Lab 3, execute the following command in the Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma directory:

    make lab3
To run task 5.1 of lab 3, run the following command in Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma/lab3/task5_1_x directory:
 

    make -f task5_1.mk
To run task 5.2 of lab 3, run the following command in Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma/lab3/task5_2_x directory:
 

    make -f task5_2.mk
To run task 5.3 of lab 3, run the following command in Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma/lab3/task5_3_x directory:
 

    make -f task5_3.mk
   

## Booth Multiplication Task

The file booth.c contains the source code for Booth Multiplication and its test cases. To compile and run the Booth Multiplication executable with different test cases, execute the following command in the Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma directory:

    make booth

## Lab 5

The folder named lab5 contains the tcl files. To run both of the files write the following command in the Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma directory:

    make lab5
## 	Maze code
To compile and run maze code execute the following command in the Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training/Masooma directory:

    make maze
